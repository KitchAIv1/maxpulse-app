## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Connect to your Supabase project and run:
psql -h your-project.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres -f migrations/012_health_conversations_schema.sql
```

### 2. Review and Test

- Verify symptom analysis logic
- Test product recommendation consent flow
- Validate compliance disclaimers

### 3. OpenAI API Integration (Optional for MVP)
The SymptomAnalysisEngine has a placeholder for OpenAI API integration:
