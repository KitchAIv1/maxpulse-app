# 🔍 Root Cause Analysis: Import/Export Mismatch

## The Real Problem

**Error:** `TypeError: Cannot read property 'getInstance' of undefined`

**Root Cause:** Import/export mismatch between `HealthConversationStorage` and `OfflineQueueService`

---

## Technical Deep Dive

### The Bug

**File:** `src/services/coach/HealthConversationStorage.ts`

**Line 6 (WRONG):**
```typescript
import { OfflineQueueService } from '../OfflineQueueService';  // ❌ Named import
```

**But in `OfflineQueueService.ts` line 229:**
```typescript
export default OfflineQueueService;  // Default export
```

### Why This Caused the Crash

1. **Named import expects named export:**
   ```typescript
   // This would work:
   export { OfflineQueueService };  // Named export
   import { OfflineQueueService } from '...';  // Named import ✅
   ```

2. **Default export requires default import:**
   ```typescript
   // This is what we have:
   export default OfflineQueueService;  // Default export
   import OfflineQueueService from '...';  // Default import ✅
   ```

3. **What happened:**
   ```typescript
   // Wrong combination:
   export default OfflineQueueService;  // Default export
   import { OfflineQueueService } from '...';  // Named import ❌
   
   // Result: OfflineQueueService = undefined
   ```

4. **When constructor ran:**
   ```typescript
   private constructor() {
     this.offlineQueue = OfflineQueueService.getInstance();
     //                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ undefined!
     //                   undefined.getInstance() → TypeError!
   }
   ```

---

## The Fix

**Changed line 6 in `HealthConversationStorage.ts`:**

```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
import { OfflineQueueService } from '../OfflineQueueService';

// After (CORRECT):
import OfflineQueueService from '../OfflineQueueService';
```

---

## Why Previous Fixes Didn't Work

### Attempt 1: Lazy Initialization
**What we tried:** Call `getInstance()` only when needed, not at component level

**Why it failed:** The import mismatch was still there. Even with lazy loading, when the constructor ran, `OfflineQueueService` was still `undefined`.

### Attempt 2: Dynamic Import
**What we tried:** Use `import()` to load module on-demand

**Why it failed:** Dynamic import loaded `HealthConversationStorage` successfully, but when its constructor tried to instantiate `OfflineQueueService`, the named import was still wrong.

**Evidence from logs:**
```
Line 1003: iOS Bundled 316ms src/services/coach/HealthConversationStorage.ts (552 modules)
Line 1004: ERROR ❌ Failed to load HealthConversationStorage: [TypeError: Cannot read property 'getInstance' of undefined]
```

The module loaded (line 1003) but crashed in the constructor (line 1004).

## How We Found It

### Investigation Steps:

1. **Checked export in `OfflineQueueService.ts`:**
   ```typescript
   export default OfflineQueueService;  // Line 229
   ```

2. **Checked import in `HealthConversationStorage.ts`:**
   ```typescript
   import { OfflineQueueService } from '../OfflineQueueService';  // Line 6 - MISMATCH!
   ```

3. **Verified other files using `OfflineQueueService`:**
   ```typescript
   // src/services/SyncManager.ts - Line 53 (CORRECT)
   import OfflineQueueService from './OfflineQueueService';
   this.offlineQueue = OfflineQueueService.getInstance();  // ✅ Works
   ```

4. **Conclusion:** Only `HealthConversationStorage` had the wrong import style.

## Import/Export Patterns in Codebase

### Correct Patterns:

**Pattern 1: Default Export + Default Import**
```typescript
// File: OfflineQueueService.ts
export default OfflineQueueService;

// File: SyncManager.ts
import OfflineQueueService from './OfflineQueueService';  // ✅
```

**Pattern 2: Named Export + Named Import**
```typescript
// File: OfflineQueueService.ts
export interface QueuedOperation { ... }

// File: HealthConversationStorage.ts
import { QueuedOperation } from '../OfflineQueueService';  // ✅
```

### Incorrect Pattern (What We Had):

```typescript
// File: OfflineQueueService.ts
export default OfflineQueueService;

// File: HealthConversationStorage.ts
import { OfflineQueueService } from '../OfflineQueueService';  // ❌ WRONG!
```

---

## Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

1. **TypeScript didn't error:** The import syntax is valid, just returns `undefined`
2. **Linter passed:** No syntax errors
3. **Only failed at runtime:** When constructor tried to call `getInstance()` on `undefined`
4. **Crash happened on unmount:** Not during component mount, so harder to debug

---

## Verification

### Before Fix:
```typescript
import { OfflineQueueService } from '../OfflineQueueService';
console.log(OfflineQueueService);  // undefined
OfflineQueueService.getInstance();  // TypeError!
```

### After Fix:
```typescript
import OfflineQueueService from '../OfflineQueueService';
console.log(OfflineQueueService);  // [class OfflineQueueService]
OfflineQueueService.getInstance();  // ✅ Works!
```

## Expected Logs After Fix

### On Chat Close:
```
💾 Saving conversation on unmount...
✅ Conversation saved successfully
```

### On Symptom Detection:
```
🩺 Symptom-related message detected
📊 Analysis complete. Has AI response: true
✅ Using AI-generated response
✅ Symptom report saved: [uuid]
✅ 3 recommendations saved
```

### No More Errors:
```
❌ Failed to load HealthConversationStorage: [TypeError...]  // GONE!
```

---

## Database Verification

After this fix, you should see data in all tables:

### health_conversations:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM health_conversations 
WHERE user_id = '7c7548a4-012a-4680-aa0f-c0fe60c2b4d1';
-- Expected: > 0
```

### symptom_reports:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM symptom_reports 
WHERE user_id = '7c7548a4-012a-4680-aa0f-c0fe60c2b4d1';
-- Expected: > 0
```

### health_recommendations:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM health_recommendations 
WHERE user_id = '7c7548a4-012a-4680-aa0f-c0fe60c2b4d1';
-- Expected: > 0
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Import/Export Consistency
Always match import style with export style:
- Default export → Default import
- Named export → Named import

### 2. Constructor Dependencies
Be careful with dependencies in constructors:
- Ensure all imported modules are valid
- Consider lazy initialization for optional dependencies

### 3. Runtime vs Compile-time Errors
TypeScript can't catch all errors:
- Import mismatches are valid syntax
- Only fail at runtime when accessed

### 4. Debugging Strategies
When facing "undefined" errors:
1. Check import/export statements first
2. Verify module is actually exporting what you think
3. Test imports in isolation
4. Look for similar working code in codebase

## Files Changed

### Modified (1):
- `src/services/coach/HealthConversationStorage.ts` - Line 6: Changed to default import

### No Changes Needed:
- `src/components/coach/CoachScreen.tsx` - Dynamic import approach is still good
- `src/services/OfflineQueueService.ts` - Export is correct
