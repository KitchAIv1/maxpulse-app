## 🚧 **PLANNED BUT NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

These were mentioned in our strategic planning discussion but are **NOT in the current system prompt**:

### ❌ **Intelligence Layers** (Future Enhancements)

#### 1. **Pattern Recognition** ❌
- ❌ Proactive trend identification
- ❌ "I've noticed your sleep has been declining"
- ❌ Correlate symptoms with health metrics over time
- ❌ Identify recurring patterns

**Why not implemented**: Requires database queries and historical analysis beyond current scope.

#### 2. **Predictive Alerts** ❌
- ❌ "Based on your patterns, you might experience..."
- ❌ Preventive health notifications
- ❌ Risk factor identification

**Why not implemented**: Requires ML models and historical data analysis.

#### 3. **Intelligent Questioning** ✅ (PARTIALLY)
- ✅ Asks follow-up questions
- ❌ Dynamic question trees based on responses
- ❌ Adaptive questioning strategy

**Why partially**: Basic follow-ups work, but not sophisticated question trees.

#### 4. **Personalized Health Education** ❌
- ❌ Tailored articles and resources
- ❌ Educational content recommendations
- ❌ Learning path based on user's conditions

**Why not implemented**: Requires content database and recommendation engine.

#### 5. **Action Plans & Protocols** ❌
- ❌ Structured step-by-step plans
- ❌ "Here's your 7-day sleep improvement plan"
- ❌ Progress tracking on action plans

**Why not implemented**: Requires plan templates and tracking system.

#### 6. **Emotional Intelligence** ✅ (BASIC)
- ✅ Empathetic language ("I hear you", "That must be challenging")
- ❌ Detect emotional state from text
- ❌ Adjust tone based on user's mood
- ❌ Provide emotional support strategies

**Why partially**: Basic empathy works, but not advanced emotion detection.

#### 7. **Integration & Coordination** ❌
- ❌ Prepare doctor visit summaries
- ❌ Export health reports
- ❌ Coordinate with wearable devices
- ❌ Medication reminders

**Why not implemented**: Requires external integrations and data export features.

## 💡 Why the Difference?

**Strategic Planning vs MVP1 Implementation**

During our strategic planning, I outlined a **comprehensive vision** of what Max AI *could become* - this was to help you understand the full potential and plan for future phases.

For **MVP1 (current implementation)**, we focused on:
- ✅ Core conversational AI
- ✅ Symptom analysis
- ✅ Safety & compliance
- ✅ Natural recommendations
- ✅ Basic empathy

The advanced features (pattern recognition, predictive alerts, action plans, etc.) were **strategic roadmap items** for future development, not MVP1 deliverables.
