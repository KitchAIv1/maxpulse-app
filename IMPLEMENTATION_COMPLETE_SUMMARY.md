## How It Works

### Flow Diagram
```
User Opens Chat
    â†“
Generate sessionId (UUID)
Get userId from Supabase auth
Initialize conversationMessages ref
    â†“
User Sends Message
    â†“
Track in conversationMessages.current
Call AICoachService.generateResponse()
    â†“
AI Generates Response (OpenAI)
    â†“
Track AI message in conversationMessages.current
    â†“
If Symptom Detected:
  â†’ Save symptom report immediately
  â†’ Save recommendations immediately
    â†“
User Closes Chat
    â†“
useEffect cleanup runs
    â†“
Save entire conversation to health_conversations
    â†“
If Save Fails:
  â†’ Queue in OfflineQueueService
  â†’ Retry when online
```

## Database Queries for Verification

### View Latest Conversations
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  session_id,
  conversation_type,
  summary,
  started_at,
  (metadata->>'message_count')::int as message_count
FROM health_conversations
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### View Symptom Reports
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  symptom_type,
  symptom_description,
  severity,
  confidence_score,
  reported_at
FROM symptom_reports
ORDER BY reported_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### View Recommendations
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  recommendation_type,
  recommendation_text,
  confidence_score,
  priority
FROM health_recommendations
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### View Full Conversation with Links
```sql
SELECT 
  c.id as conversation_id,
  c.session_id,
  c.summary,
  c.conversation_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sr.id) as symptom_reports,
  COUNT(DISTINCT hr.id) as recommendations
FROM health_conversations c
LEFT JOIN symptom_reports sr ON sr.conversation_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN health_recommendations hr ON hr.conversation_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.id
ORDER BY c.started_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented âœ…
- Batch saves (conversation saved once at end)
- Ref-based tracking (no re-renders)
- Fire-and-forget saves (non-blocking UI)
- Efficient batch inserts for recommendations
- Smart offline queueing

### Metrics
- **Database writes per session:** 1-3 (very efficient!)
- **Memory per message:** ~1KB
- **Typical session:** 10 messages = ~10KB
- **UI blocking:** 0ms (all async)

---

## Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance âœ…
- Row Level Security on all tables
- Automatic audit trail
- User authentication required
- Encrypted at rest (Supabase default)
- Data retention policies supported

### Privacy âœ…
- Users can only access their own data
- Consent preferences tracked
- Product recommendations opt-in
- Data sharing controls

---

## What's Next

### Immediate Testing
1. Open AI Coach in your app
2. Have a conversation about symptoms
3. Close the chat
4. Check Supabase Table Editor
5. Verify data is saved correctly

### Future Enhancements (Not in MVP)
- Real-time message saving (crash recovery)
- Client-side encryption for PHI
- Conversation history retrieval UI
- Data retention cleanup policies
- Search/filter conversations
- Export conversation history
- Analytics dashboard

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Appearing?
1. Check user is authenticated (`userId` not null)
2. Check messages were sent (conversationMessages.current.length > 0)
3. Check chat was closed (unmount triggered)
4. Check console for error logs

### Permission Denied?
1. Verify user is authenticated
2. Check RLS policies (should allow user's own data)
3. Verify userId matches auth.uid()

### Offline Queue Not Syncing?
1. Check network connection restored
2. Call `OfflineQueueService.getInstance().processQueue()`
3. Check AsyncStorage for queued operations
