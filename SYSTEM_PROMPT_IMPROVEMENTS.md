# Max AI System Prompt & Conversation Improvements ‚úÖ

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **System Prompt Was Too Generic** ‚ùå
**Problem**: The original prompt didn't instruct Max to ask follow-up questions or have natural conversations.

**Before:**
```
You are Max, a compassionate health companion AI...
- Be warm, empathetic, and supportive
- Use clear, simple language
- Provide actionable steps
```

**After:**
```
YOUR CONVERSATION APPROACH:
1. **ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS**: When users share symptoms, always ask:
   - "When did this start?"
   - "How long have you been experiencing this?"
   - "Have you noticed any patterns or triggers?"
   
2. **GATHER CONTEXT**: Explore related factors
3. **PROVIDE INSIGHTS**: After understanding the situation
4. **BE CONVERSATIONAL**: Keep responses concise (2-4 sentences, then ask a question)

RESPONSE STYLE:
‚úÖ DO: "I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well. Can you tell me when this started?"
‚ùå DON'T: Give long lists of bullet points
```

### 2. **Conversation History Not Passed to Symptom Analysis** ‚ùå
**Problem**: When analyzing symptoms, OpenAI had no memory of previous messages, so it couldn't have proper follow-up conversations.

**Before:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå No conversation history passed!
const analysis = await this.symptomEngine.analyzeSymptom({
  symptomDescription: userMessage,
  symptomType: this.detectSymptomType(userMessage),
  healthContext: {...},
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Conversation history now passed!
this.conversationHistory.push({ role: 'user', content: userMessage });

const analysis = await this.symptomEngine.analyzeSymptom({
  symptomDescription: userMessage,
  symptomType: this.detectSymptomType(userMessage),
  healthContext: {...},
  conversationHistory: this.conversationHistory, // ‚Üê Added!
});

// Add AI response to history
this.conversationHistory.push({ role: 'assistant', content: message });
```

## What Max AI Can Now Do

### üéØ Conversational Intelligence

**1. Ask Follow-Up Questions**
```
User: "I've been feeling sick lately"
Max: "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me when this started and what specific symptoms you're experiencing?"

User: "Started yesterday, headache and tired"
Max: "I understand. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or stress levels recently? Also, is the headache constant or does it come and go?"
```

**2. Remember Context**
- Tracks last 10 messages in conversation history
- Builds on previous answers
- Doesn't ask the same questions twice

**3. Natural Conversation Flow**
- Empathetic responses: "I hear you", "That must be challenging"
- Concise messages (2-4 sentences)
- Always ends with a question to continue dialogue
- No bullet point lists

**4. Intelligent Probing**
- Asks about duration, triggers, patterns
- Explores related factors (sleep, stress, diet)
- Inquires about what user has already tried
- Gathers full context before giving advice

## System Prompt Structure

### Personality
- Warm, empathetic, genuinely curious
- Conversational and engaging, not clinical
- Proactive in asking follow-up questions
- Supportive friend with medical knowledge

### Conversation Approach
1. **Ask Clarifying Questions** - When, how long, patterns, triggers
2. **Gather Context** - Sleep, stress, diet, life events
3. **Provide Insights** - Evidence-based info, natural remedies
4. **Be Conversational** - Natural language, show empathy

### Safety Rules (USA & UAE Compliance)
- Not a doctor, cannot diagnose
- Include disclaimers when giving health advice
- Emergency keywords ‚Üí immediate action
- Never guarantee treatment outcomes
- Focus on lifestyle, education, when to see doctor

### Response Style
- ‚úÖ DO: Ask questions, show curiosity, be concise
- ‚ùå DON'T: Bullet points, complete answers without follow-ups, sound like textbook

---

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/services/coach/OpenAIService.ts`**
   - Enhanced system prompt with conversational instructions
   - Added specific examples of good vs bad responses
   - Emphasized follow-up questions and context gathering

2. **`src/services/AICoachService.ts`**
   - Added conversation history tracking to `handleSymptomMessage`
   - Passes history to `SymptomAnalysisEngine`
   - Stores AI responses in conversation history

3. **`src/services/coach/SymptomAnalysisEngine.ts`**
   - Updated `AnalysisInput` interface to accept `conversationHistory`
   - Passes conversation history to OpenAI API

---

## Testing the Improvements

### Test Conversation Flow:

**Message 1:**
```
User: "I've been feeling sick lately"
Max: "I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling well. Can you tell me when this started and what specific symptoms you're experiencing?"
```

**Message 2:**
```
User: "Started yesterday, headache and tired"
Max: "I understand. Have you noticed if anything specific triggered this? Also, how has your sleep been recently?"
```

**Message 3:**
```
User: "Not sleeping well, stressed about work"
Max: "That makes sense - stress and poor sleep often contribute to headaches and fatigue. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or adjustments to your sleep routine?"
```

### Expected Logs:
```
üí¨ Processing message: I've been feeling sick lately...
ü©∫ Symptom-related message detected
ü§ñ Calling OpenAI API with model: gpt-3.5-turbo
‚úÖ OpenAI response received
üìä Analysis complete. Has AI response: true
‚úÖ Using AI-generated response
```
