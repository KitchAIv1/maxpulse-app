**Branch:** `feature/ai-coach-health-mvp1`  
**Status:** ✅ **FULLY INTEGRATED AND READY**

## 🎉 Integration Summary

The AI Coach MVP1 health-focused implementation is now **100% integrated** and functional. All new health services are connected to the existing UI through the `AICoachService` with full backward compatibility.

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Backward-Compatible Integration
**Approach:** Updated existing `AICoachService.ts` to use new health services internally, ensuring zero breaking changes.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No changes needed to `CoachScreen.tsx`
- ✅ No changes needed to any other components
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ New health features automatically available

### 2. AICoachService Enhancements

**File:** `src/services/AICoachService.ts` (now 885 lines)

**New Features Added:**
- ✅ Integration with `ComplianceService` for USA/UAE regulations
- ✅ Integration with `SymptomAnalysisEngine` for symptom processing
- ✅ Integration with `HealthRecommendationService` for recommendations
- ✅ Health-focused greeting message ("Hi! I'm Max, your health companion 💙")
- ✅ Emergency keyword detection with immediate response
- ✅ Symptom-related message detection and analysis
- ✅ Health data correlation (sleep, hydration, activity)
- ✅ Compliance disclaimers on all health advice
- ✅ Feature toggle (`useHealthFocusedLogic`) for easy rollback

**New Methods Added:**
```typescript
- isSymptomRelated() - Detects symptom keywords
- handleSymptomMessage() - Processes symptoms with new engine
- detectSymptomType() - Categorizes symptom types
```

### 3. Health-Focused Quick Actions

**Updated in `ChatComposer.tsx`:**
- ✅ "Wellness Check" - Health assessment
- ✅ "Describe symptoms" - Open-ended symptom sharing
- ✅ "Physical discomfort" - Physical symptom focus
- ✅ "Mood & energy" - Mental/emotional health
- ✅ "Sleep issues" - Sleep-related concerns

**Removed fitness-focused actions:**
- ❌ "Log hydration" (+8oz water)
- ❌ "Check my Life Score"
- ❌ "Boost my score"
- ❌ "Plan week"

### 4. Updated User Experience

**Greeting Message:**
```
Before: "Hi! I'm your wellness coach 🌟"
After:  "Hi! I'm Max, your health companion 💙

I'm here to listen to your health concerns, help you understand symptoms, 
and provide personalized wellness guidance..."
```

**Empty State:**
```
Before: "Welcome to Coach!"
After:  "Welcome to Max Health Coach"
```

**Placeholder Text:**
```
Before: "Describe how you're feeling, ask questions, or share symptoms..."
After:  "Tell me about your symptoms, health concerns, or how you're feeling..."
```

## 🔄 How It Works
